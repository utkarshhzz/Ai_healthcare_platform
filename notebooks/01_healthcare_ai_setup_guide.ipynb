    "\n",
    "Setting up Git is crucial so you can push your project to GitHub and clone it on your other laptop for GPU training!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why Git & GitHub?\n",
    "- **Version Control**: Track every change you make\n",
    "- **Backup**: Your code is safe in the cloud\n",
    "- **Multi-device**: Work on different laptops seamlessly\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Share with others or get help\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository\n",
    "Open your terminal in the project folder and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git init\n",
    "git branch -M main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Configure Git (First time only)\n",

    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Step 3: Create .gitignore (Already done! ✅)\n",
    "Our .gitignore file prevents uploading large files and sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Create GitHub Repository\n",
    "1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)\n",
    "2. Click \"New Repository\"\n",
    "3. Name it: `ai-healthcare-platform`\n",
    "4. Make it **Public** (for learning) or **Private** (for privacy)\n",
    "5. **Don't** initialize with README (we have one!)\n",
    "6. Copy the repository URL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Connect Local to GitHub\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-healthcare-platform.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: First Commit & Push\n",

    "git commit -m \"🎉 Initial project setup with requirements and structure\"\n",
    "git push -u origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 When to Clone on Your GPU Laptop:\n",
    "**After Section 6** when we start training neural networks, you'll run:\n",
